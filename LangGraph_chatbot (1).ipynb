            "You: Types of AI\n",
            "DEBUG clarify result: clear\n",
            "Bot: AI can be categorized in several ways, but one of the most common and fundamental distinctions is based on its capabilities and intelligence level. Here are the three main \"types\" in this regard:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Narrow AI (ANI - Artificial Narrow Intelligence) / Weak AI:**\n",
            "    *   **Description:** This is the only type of AI that currently exists and is widely used. Narrow AI is designed and trained for a specific task or a very limited range of tasks. It can perform these tasks exceptionally well, often surpassing human capabilities in that particular domain.\n",
            "    *   **Limitations:** It lacks general cognitive abilities and cannot perform tasks outside its programmed scope. It doesn't \"understand\" or have consciousness; it simply executes its function based on the data it was trained on.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)\n",
            "        *   Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)\n",
            "        *   Spam filters\n",
            "        *   Facial recognition software\n",
            "        *   Self-driving car systems (they are excellent at driving but can't, for example, write a novel)\n",
            "        *   Medical diagnosis tools\n",
            "        *   Game-playing AI (like DeepMind's AlphaGo)\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **General AI (AGI - Artificial General Intelligence) / Strong AI:**\n",
            "    *   **Description:** This type of AI would possess human-level cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks. An AGI would be able to understand, learn, and apply intelligence to any intellectual task that a human being can, including abstract reasoning, problem-solving, planning, learning from experience, and natural language comprehension.\n",
            "    *   **Status:** AGI is currently hypothetical and an aspirational goal for many AI researchers. We do not yet have true AGI.\n",
            "    *   **Challenges:** Creating AGI involves overcoming significant hurdles in areas like common sense reasoning, creativity, and the ability to transfer knowledge between different domains seamlessly.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Super AI (ASI - Artificial Super Intelligence):**\n",
            "    *   **Description:** This refers to AI that would surpass human intelligence and capabilities in virtually every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. An ASI would not only be able to perform tasks better than humans but also potentially develop new knowledge and insights that are beyond human comprehension.\n",
            "    *   **Status:** ASI is purely speculative and remains in the realm of science fiction. It's often discussed in philosophical and ethical contexts regarding the future of humanity.\n",
            "    *   **Implications:** The concept of ASI raises profound questions about control, ethics, and the potential impact on human civilization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond these capability-based types, AI can also be categorized by its **functional approaches** (e.g., Reactive Machines, Limited Memory, Theory of Mind, Self-Aware AI - as proposed by AI pioneer Arend Hintze) or by its **subfields/methodologies** (e.g., Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Robotics). However, the Narrow/General/Super distinction is most common when discussing the \"types\" of AI intelligence itself.\n",

            "Bot: We've covered quite a bit! Here's a summary of our earlier conversations:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **What is AI?** We discussed its definition, core concepts like learning, problem-solving, and natural language understanding, and everyday examples.\n",
            "2.  **Applications of AI:** We delved into various fields where AI is being applied, including everyday assistance, healthcare, autonomous systems, finance, content creation, and security.\n",
            "3.  **Types of AI:** We explored the three main categories based on capability and intelligence level: Narrow AI (ANI), General AI (AGI), and Super AI (ASI).\n",
